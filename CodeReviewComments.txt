Review Comments:
- Removed Gradle files as Maven will be used
- Default packages should not be used.
- No use of abstraction; will be using Page object model [POM] to implement it
- No use of Encapsulation; will be using Data access object[DAO] design pattern to implement it
- Everything stuffed into a single file; will be taking out global configuration values from it & create a properties file to achieve it
- Will be seperating test data & will be creating one JSON/Excel/properties file to list that data.
- Test data needs to be organised in a defined structure; i propose using below sctructure
	-Sprint X
		- JIRA - A
		- JIRA - B
	- Sprint Y
		- Jira - C
		- Jira - D
i.e. segrigating the data based on sprints; hava one file per sprint & within that file; have different JIRA ticket number section; have your test data in that section.
- method 'setDriverPath' is common in all the scripts, it should be taken out & moved into a seperate class /utility
- Strategy used to identify webElemenst seems to be inadequate, they doesn't seems to be unique 
- Use a seperate property file per page to maintain these locators on that page; so that they can reused

-- don't see any use of TestNG done in the scripts, use atleast below annotations for a better testEngine
--	TestNg.xml file missing; need to add it & list the tests to be executed there.
